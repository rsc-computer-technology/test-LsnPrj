# Lesson 5 Project

For this project, you will begin styling your first web page within inline style sheets utilizing the template you created as a jumping off point. 

## Preparation and Tips
1. Read through all the project directions before beginning so you know what you will be doing. 
2. Be sure to save as you go, especially before you begin each portion of the project.
3. If your instructor made comments to your Lesson 4 assignment regarding changes you need to make to your template, be sure you implement those changes before proceeding with this assignment.

## Project Directions
1. If necessary, open the template.html file in your Lesson 4 course folder.
2. Save the template.html file as a new file in your Lesson 5 course folder with the name: inline_css.html.
3. **Update the metadata** on the page:
   1. Add a minimum of 5 keywords appropriate for the page content.
   2. Add a brief description.
   3. Update the page title to follow this format: FirstName's Inline CSS Page, where you replace FirstName with your first name.
4. Update the multi-line comment as needed to match the information for this lesson. 
5. Update the first-level heading to read: Applying Inline CSS.
6. Comment out the navigation menu.
7. In the Main section,
   1. You will need to have two (2) paragraphs:
      1. In the first paragraph, briefly explain the difference between the generic font families.
      2. In the second paragraph, briefly explain the different color methods. 
   2. You will need to have a second-level heading before each paragraph. Provide appropriate text for the headings to go with each paragraph below.

### Apply CSS
Using inline style sheets, add the following styles to your page.
1. Center align all elements within the header. Do this with the least number of inline styles as possible. 
2. Right align all elements within the footer. Do this with the least number of inline styles as possible.
3. Use a declaration block on the first-level heading to style it based upon the following criteria:
   1. Apply a color of your choosing using any color method.
   2. Change the font size using an absolute value.
   3. Select a set of fonts and apply them to the first-level heading.
   4. Add a comment before the heading briefly explaining what will happen if the first font listed is not available to the end user, using your selected fonts as a guide.
4. Modify the font weight of the slogan paragraph within the page header to make it bolder in appearance.
   1. Add a comment before the paragraph to identify the type of value you used for the font-weight.
5. For each of the second-level headings:
   1. Apply a color of your choosing.
   2. Other than the color method used in step 3, use the two remaining color methods, one for each second-level heading.
6. For the first paragraph within the main section, use the font shorthand property to:
   1. Apply a set of sans-serif styled fonts.
   2. Increase the font size using a relative value.
7. For the second paragraph within the main section, use the font shorthand property to:
   1. Apply a set of monospace styled fonts.
